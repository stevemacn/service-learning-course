### Grading 1610/3210

The grading criteria is very flexible. Students may take this course for a
variety of reasons: giving back to the community, leading a service
project, or designing your own service project. The grading scheme may be
adjusted to reflect each of these diverse goals.

**All students (40%)**

- Meets volunteer hours for semester (20%)
- Written reflections (10%)
- Evaludation plan for the semester (10%)

**Role-based Grade (60%)**

This grade will be determined by the evaluation plan that you create. Both the instructor and the team will agree on evaluation plans for each role within each team. These plans are determined by you and your team because each team will have different roles, goals, and responsibilities.

### Collaboration

Collaboration is an essential part of doing good work. In preparing
this course, I asked for advice from my faculty mentors: Celine Latulipe and
Jamie Payton. Similarly, if you ask for advice or you recruit students to
help you with a project, you should give them credit and thank them for
helping you. As a leader, it is your job to make the people that you
lead look good.

So, if someone helps you in any way (even just as a sounding board) be sure to
give them credit in your work.

### Academic honesty

I expect that all of the work that you turn in to me is your own. If some aspect
of your work came from a collaboration it is your responsibility to not only
acknowledge it but also to cite it properly (if in doubt, email me).
