### Late work policy

Late work will not be penalized in terms of grading. However, when handing
in late work, students will be expected to write an abstract about a topic
of the instructor's choosing. The instructor may also choose to let students
submit an relevant video to the resource page of the website.

### Collaboration

Collaboration is an essential part of doing good work. In preparing
this course, I asked for advice from my faculty mentors: Celine Latulipe and
Jamie Payton. Similarly, if you ask for advice or you recruit students to
help you with a project, you should give them credit and thank them for
helping you. As a leader, it is your job to make the people that you
lead look good.

So, if someone helps you in any way (even just as a sounding board) be sure to
give them credit in your work.

### Academic honesty

I expect that all of the work that you turn in to me is your own. If some aspect
of your work came from a collaboration it is your responsibility to not only
acknowledge it but also to cite it properly (if in doubt, email me).
