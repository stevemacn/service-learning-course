### Course Overview

This course is designed to provide outreach to local communities. 

The class emulates a [seed accelerator / startup incubator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_accelerator). Students will form teams and identify problems that are socially-relevant. These teams will act as startups with each team-member assuming some role within the startup. The startup will be mentored by the instructor and either a faculty or industry member as available. The startup will develop and market their solution which may or may not be software related. The focus of the course will not be on the project but rather on understanding the roles that are available, how they interact, and how companies can affect society. 

### Learning Goals

* Identify socially relevant problems.

### Grading 1610/3210

The grading criteria is very flexible. Students may take this course for a
variety of reasons: giving back to the community, leading a service
project, or designing your own service project. The grading scheme may be
adjusted to reflect each of these diverse goals.

**All students (50%)**

- Participate in 5 service outreach sessions (At least 2 external) (20%)
- Written reflections (10%)
- In class discussions / activies (10%)
- Evaludation plan for the semester (10%)

**Role-based Grade (50%)**

This grade will be determined by the evaluation plan that you create. Both the instructor and the team will agree on evaluation plans for each role within each team. These plans are determined by you and your team because each team will have different roles, goals, and responsibilities.

### Late work policy

of the instructor's choosing. The instructor may also choose to let students
submit an relevant video to the resource page of the website.

### Collaboration

Collaboration is an essential part of doing good work. In preparing
this course, I asked for advice from my faculty mentors: Celine Latulipe and
Jamie Payton. Similarly, if you ask for advice or you recruit students to
help you with a project, you should give them credit and thank them for
helping you. As a leader, it is your job to make the people that you
lead look good.

So, if someone helps you in any way (even just as a sounding board) be sure to
give them credit in your work.

### Academic honesty

I expect that all of the work that you turn in to me is your own. If some aspect
of your work came from a collaboration it is your responsibility to not only
acknowledge it but also to cite it properly (if in doubt, email me).
