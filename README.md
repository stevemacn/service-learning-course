# Service Learning Course at UNCC

This is the source for both the [UNC Charlotte CS 3211/12 and CS 1610/3610: Service Learning Courses Websites.][website] 

Course material is written with [Jekyll][jekyll] and deployed on
[GitHub Pages][gh-pages].



# Contributing

Contributions are welcome (and accepted pull requests from students in the
course count for extra credit!). I recommend the [Atlassian (Jira and Bitbucket)](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/) or [Github](https://guides.github.com/) tutorials if you aren't familiar with git. 

An appropriate pull request might be fixing a broken link, correcting a typo, updating an incorrect date, or even adding content such as relevant videos.
